    "# Predicting whether passenger was transported to an alternate dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "This project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone was transported to an alternate dimension based on various data like whether they were in cryo sleep or from what destination they were flying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Main motivation was taking part in Kaggle's competition. Description from Kaggle's page: \n",
    "> \"In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Following approach will be used:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given personal records about a passenger, can I predict whether or not they were transported to another dimension?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data came from the ship's damaged computer system. More importantly, from Kaggle's competition page:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Main metric used will be accuracy due to class balance.\n",
    "> The goal is achieving 90% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n",
    "2. HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "3. CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n",
    "4. Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n",
    "5. Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",
    "6. Age - The age of the passenger.\n",
    "7. VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n",
    "8. RoomService, 9. FoodCourt, 10. ShoppingMall, 11. Spa, 12. VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n",
    "13. Name - The first and last names of the passenger.\n",
    "14. Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict."
